## Bulk RNAseq analysis of an asian diabetes cohort

The analysis presented here has explored the transcriptome of whole blood in presented by "ref" [which has not been added yet]. These data contain the transcriptomic information from RNA isolated from whole blood in patentients with type 2 diabetes, diabetic nephropathy and healthy controls. 


This analysis will use the `egdeR` [@edger2010] work flow. We utilized two different methods of normalization "TMM" from `edgeR` and RUVg from `RUVSeq`. 
Enrichment analysis was then performed using GOseq (over representation analysis) and gene set enrichment analysis.
